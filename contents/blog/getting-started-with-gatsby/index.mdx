I've known about GatsbyJS for a while. I've also tried setting it up several times in the past but 
it always felt half baked to me. Tools were alaways evolving and all of the guides seemed out of date.
The initial setup would be great! Yay I can get ReactJS Components to render, but beyond that things
just wouldn't always click.

This time around, things have changed, in a BIG way. In the early versions of Gatsby you had to make
all of the decision of templating and designing yourself. There wasn't an off the shelve solution you
can simply install like a node module.
